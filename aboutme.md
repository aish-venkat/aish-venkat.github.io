## Food Systems Analyst | Methodologist | Cartographer

I am a recent doctoral graduate from the [Friedman School of Nutrition Science & Policy at Tufts University](https://nutrition.tufts.edu/) with a specialty in [Agriculture, Food, and Environment](https://nutrition.tufts.edu/academics/degree-programs/agriculture-food-environment). Prior to this, I earned my MS in [Environmental Engineering](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cee/) from Tufts University, and a BS in [Biological Systems Engineering](https://www.bse.vt.edu/) from Virginia Tech.

I specialize in data wrangling and spatiotemporal harmonization to extract interdisciplinary insights for food systems. My subject matter expertise includes extreme weather event measurement, climate dynamics, acute malnutrition seasonality, diet costs and affordability, and famine early warning.

My skills include:
* Remote sensing analytics for food security, agriculture, and public health 
* Statistical analysis of census and survey data at local, national, and international scales
* Spatial statistics including clustering, point process methods, regression techniques, and space-time methods
* Geospatial analysis, vulnerability mapping, and predictive spatial modeling
* Interactive web mapping 
* Cartography and map design 

Software Expertise:
* GIS: ArcGIS, QGIS, Geoda
* Remote Sensing: ENVI, Erdas
* Programming/Statistics/Data Analysis: R, Python, Stata
* Web mapping: Carto, Mapbox, ArcGIS Online
* Data Viz: D3, Power BI, Tableau
* Design: Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Inkscape, and Office suite
