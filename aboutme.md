## Geospatial Analyst | Data Scientist | Cartographer

I am currently a Master's candidate in [Environmental and Water Resources Engineering](https://www.engineering.tufts.edu/cee) at Tufts University. I am starting a PhD in [Agriculture, Food, and Environment](https://www.nutrition.tufts.edu) in 2018. 

I have over four years of experience with geospatial methods, spatial statistics, urban planning, interactive mapping, and data visualization. I am also a research-oriented cartographer, with a knack for telling engaging spatial stories.

My areas of expertise include:
* Demographic analysis with census and survey data at local, national, and international scales
* Remote sensing data analysis for agriculture, environmental monitoring, and public health using ArcGIS, ENVI, and ERDAS
* Spatial statistics including species distribution models and point process methods using R, Python, and Geoda
* Interactive web mapping using Mapbox, Carto, and Google Maps
* Geospatial analysis and modeling for urban planning, environmental engineering, hydrology, and natural resources management using ArcMap and QGIS
* Cartography and map design using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Inkscape, and GIMP
