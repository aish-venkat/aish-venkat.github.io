I am currently a Master's candidate in [Environmental and Water Resources Engineering](https://www.engineering.tufts.edu/cee) at Tufts University, and I am starting a PhD in [Agriculture, Food, and Environment](https://www.nutrition.tufts.edu) in 2018. My primary skillset includes geospatial analysis, geostatistics, and remote sensing applications to infectious disease modeling, agriculture, and natural resources management.
